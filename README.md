# ZHdK 2018 Portfolio

This is not intended for re-use, but if you can get something out of the code... Just leave the projects alone please.

## How To Build

You'll need to install `less` to run `build.sh`:

```
npm install -g less
```

After which you can build the project by running:

```
./build.sh
```

If you want the filewatcher, you also need `fswatch` which should be available anywhere you can run bash. On OSX it would be:

```
brew install fswatch
```

After which you can let `watcher.sh` run in the background:

```
./watcher.sh
```
